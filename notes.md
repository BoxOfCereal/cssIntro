@Noah no problem! I used to have a very clean simple myspace layout & wanted to do the same w this. 


How can I change the links colors on my profile? Like the entire thing, contacts, view my, interests, comments etc?



How can I change the interests table to be different colors than blue, either white or pink. 

And how can I change the orange tabs on the profile as well. 

Thank you I know itâ€™s a lot no rush! Even if you just typed a template I could copy and paste that would be cool. I used w3 for the color lists so I could probably plug colors  in if needed.. hopefully lol
